Computing weight 3 modular forms for H.
Done.
Call to ratfuncrep with deg = 6.
Building last 7 rows of the matrix.
Using coefficients 0 to 13/5.
Time taken was 0.000.
Building the first 7 rows of the matrix.
Time taken was 0.010.
Solving the linear system of size 14x14.
Time taken was 0.000.
Null space has dimension 1.
Success! The linear system worked.
The result was (4*t^4 - 4*t^3 + t^2)/(t^6 - 18*t^5 + 75*t^4 + 75*t^2 + 18*t + 
1).
Call to ratfuncrep with deg = 12.
Building last 13 rows of the matrix.
Using coefficients -1 to 4.
Time taken was 0.000.
Building the first 13 rows of the matrix.
Time taken was 0.010.
Solving the linear system of size 26x26.
Time taken was 0.000.
Null space has dimension 1.
Success! The linear system worked.
The result was (t^12 - 36*t^11 + 474*t^10 - 2700*t^9 + 5775*t^8 - 936*t^7 - 
8404*t^6 + 936*t^5 + 5775*t^4 + 2700*t^3 + 474*t^2 + 36*t + 1)/(t^7 - 11*t^6 - 
t^5).
Universal elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + (-27*t^4 + 324*t^3 - 378*t^2 - 324*t - 
27)*x + 54*t^6 - 972*t^5 + 4050*t^4 + 4050*t^2 + 972*t + 54.
